    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe on how to make good guacamole! I love guacamole ever since working at Chipotle and have made it numerous times for myself
        at home.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 Avocados</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Lime Juice</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Onion</li>
        <li>1/8 Cup Jalapeno</li>
        <li> 2 Teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse off your avocados, lime, onion, jalapeno, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Place your cilantro on cutting board and cut the cilantro into small, 1/8th pieces as best as possible. 
            Be careful and do no not bruise the cilantro. Once done, set aside the cilantro.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse off cutting board and place jalapeno on it. Cut the jalapeno in half lengthwise, and then cut it in half lengthwise again. Then
            dice the jalapenos into 1/8th pieces. Don't make them big or you'll overpower the guac. Set aside once cut.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse off cutting board and place onion on it. Cut the onion in half and then start dicing the onion into 1/8th pieces. If they are too big
            they will overpower the guac. Set aside once cut.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse off the cutting board and place lime on it. Cut lime in half and set aside.</li>
        <li>Grab your avocados and one at a time, cut the avocado open and throwaway the pit. Once opened and pit is discarded, scoop the avocado into 
            a mixing bowl or a bowl. Then, using a potato smasher, spatula, or spoon, mash the avocado until you a creamy texture. Or if you like it chunky, 
            leave some chunks in it.
        </li>
        <li>Pour all of the prepared ingredients into the bowl along with the salt. Mix together evenly and bam! You have guac!</li>
    </ol>
